- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jaimie Black (they/them please!)
- I am learning Go right now.
- I like to write books as much as I like to write code, so I've dabbled in building novel writing software a few times
  - look at OsmosisWriter if you want to see some of my... earliest... code.
  - And check out Gwab (**Go** Write a Book) for my most recent excursion into creating software in Golang.
